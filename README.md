# rocmics
Teneille's repository for all data processing and analyses related to the ROCMICS project, which investigates the effects of enhanced mineral weathering on soil organic carbon dynamics based on a field trial in Malle, Belgium.
All raw data lives in "csv_files" subfolder, all R and Quarto scripts live in "scripts" subfolder and all outputs (e.g. markdown and figures) are found in "docs" subfolder, which enables hosting Git Pages (website view of html files).
